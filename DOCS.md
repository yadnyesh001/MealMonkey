# MealMonkey  

## Understand the Problem  

### 1. Who has a stake in the solution to the problem?  
**Stakeholders**:  
- **Admin**: Oversees the system and monitors statistics, users, and profits.  
- **Customer**: Orders food, books tables, and leaves reviews.  
- **Restaurant Owner**: Manages the menu, views orders and reviews, and analyzes statistics.  
- **Delivery Partner**: Handles order deliveries and views delivery details.  
- **Guest User**: Browses restaurant menus but cannot order food.  
- **Business Owners**: Earn revenue through commissions and platform success.  
- **Third-party Services**: Includes payment gateways, mapping services, and analytics tools.  

### 2. What are the unknowns?  
**Unknowns**:  
- **Data**:  
  - Customer profiles, order history, cart details, wallet balances.  
  - Restaurant information, menus, ratings, and reviews.  
  - Delivery details, locations, and real-time order statuses.  
  - Admin statistics such as profits, user counts, and restaurant insights.  

- **Functions**:  
  - Filtering restaurants by item or location.  
  - Managing orders, reviews, and notifications for all user roles.  
  - Wallet-based payment distribution logic.  

- **Features**:  
  - Secure authentication and user-specific dashboards.  
  - Real-time order tracking for customers and delivery partners.  
  - Multi-level analytics for admin and restaurant users.  
  - Notifications and real-time updates for orders and actions.  

- **Uncertainties**:  
  - How many users the platform can handle concurrently.  
  - How to optimize the wallet distribution model for scalability.  
  - User feedback on complex features like order tracking and analytics.  

### 3. Can the problem be compartmentalized?  
**Yes**, the problem can be divided into smaller components:  
- **Customer Module**:  
  - Browse restaurants and menus.  
  - Manage cart and place orders.  
  - Write and view reviews.  
- **Restaurant Module**:  
  - Manage menus and profiles.  
  - View orders, reviews, and statistics.  
- **Delivery Partner Module**:  
  - Accept and track orders.  
  - View earnings and statistics.  
- **Admin Module**:  
  - Manage users and track global statistics.  
  - Monitor restaurant and delivery partner performance.  
- **Payment Logic**:  
  - Handle wallet deductions and distribution (80%-10%-10%).  
- **Guest User Module**:  
  - View restaurants and menus without order privileges.  

### 4. Can the problem be represented graphically?  
**Yes**, MealMonkey can be represented graphically with:  
- **Use Case Diagram**: Shows interactions for each user type (e.g., placing orders, managing menus).  
- **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**: Represents data flow between frontend and backend services.  
- **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: Maps relationships between entities like users, orders, and restaurants.  
- **Component Diagram**: Breaks the architecture into modules (frontend, backend, APIs).  
- **Sequence Diagram**: Illustrates order placement and wallet distribution processes.

## Plan the Solution  

### 1. Have you seen similar problems before?  
**Yes**, the concept is similar to platforms like Zomato, Uber Eats, and Swiggy.  

**Recognizable Patterns**:  
- Role-based dashboards for different user types.  
- Filtering and searching restaurants and dishes.  
- Real-time order tracking and notifications.  
- Wallet-based payment systems.  

### 2. Has a similar problem been solved?  
**Yes**, and some elements are reusable:  

- **Reusable Elements**:  
  - UI patterns for dashboards, menus, and cart management.  
  - Libraries for notifications, payment gateways, and API integrations.  
  - Backend modules for user authentication, order management, and role-based access.  
  - Real-time tracking features using WebSockets or Map APIs.  

- **Innovative Additions**:  
  - Multi-user role management in a single platform.  
  - Real-time wallet distribution logic with scalability.  
  - Advanced analytics for admin and restaurant owners.  

### 3. Can subproblems be defined?  
**Yes**, the subproblems can be defined for the MealMonkey project, and the solutions are:  
- **User Management**:  
  - Handling different types of users (admin, customer, restaurant, delivery agent).  
  - Solution: Use role-based authentication and separate dashboards for each role.  

- **Order and Payment Management**:  
  - Managing orders, payments, and wallet distribution.  
  - Solution: Create logic to calculate the split (80% restaurant, 10% admin, 10% delivery agent) and update wallets.  

- **Menu and Restaurant Details**:  
  - Allow customers to view and filter menus and restaurants.  
  - Solution: Use filters and search functionality to display relevant data dynamically.  

- **Delivery Partner Features**:  
  - Accepting and tracking orders.  
  - Solution: Implement an interface for viewing orders and map-based tracking for delivery locations.  

### 4. Can you represent a solution in a manner that leads to effective implementation?  
**Yes**, the solution can be represented in a structured manner for effective implementation.  

- **Architecture Design**:  
  - **Frontend**: React with TailwindCSS, React Router, and Axios.  
  - **Backend**: Express for routing, Mongoose for querying, and JWT for authentication.  

- **Database Schema**:  
  - Define separate collections for users, restaurants, orders, reviews, and menus.  
  - Relationships can be established using references.  

- **Component Design**:  
  - **Reusable Components**: Navbar, Footer, Card, and Modal.  
  - **Role-Specific Components**: Admin Dashboard, Customer Pages, Restaurant Panel, Delivery Dashboard.  

- **Flowchart or Sequence Diagram**:  
  - **Placing an Order**: Customer → Cart → Payment → Order Confirmation.  
  - **Table Booking**: Customer → Restaurant Details → Book Table.  
  - **Order Delivery**: Restaurant → Assign Delivery → Delivery Partner Updates.
